There are 5 buttons in this circuit, and a buzzer. The pins are included in the code. 
The button separated from the other four buttons is a music player, which plays a random song (Nokia ringtone, Mario, Harry Potter, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Godfather) every time you press it.
The other buttons are a recording system. The button on the very right is the record button. If you press it, the arduino will start recording. The other three buttons are the notes C, D and E. 
To add a rest, press the record button.
You can only record one take of 32 notes + rests. To reset, press the reset button on the Arduino.
